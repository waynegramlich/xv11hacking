Some CAD files for the Neato XV11 LIDAR copied from web site that has since gone away.

## Introduction

I ran across a website called:

   https://xv11hacking.wikispaces.com/

and it had some very useful information about the Neato XV11 Lidar.

This repository at least captures the CAD files from that site.
